# TIC-TAC-TOE  [vs Computer]


The `Tic-tac-toe`  or  `noughts and crosses`  or  `Xs and Os`  or  ` X’y  O’sies `,  is basically a Paper-and-Pencil game for two players [ here, I have implemented an arena for --> Human vs Computer], X and O --> who take alternative turns ... marking the spaces in a [3×3] Grid.
The player who `first` succeeds in placing three [3] of their marks in a Diagonal, Horizontal, or Vertical row, becomes the ultimate -- `WINNER`!! 


## Modus-Operandi

* `Play the game, "unlimited" times [vs computer] and boost your skills, for the final showdown!`
* `Place the cell-number to place your set piece ('X'). Remember, the input should be between [1 to 9] in integer numerics.`


### ALL THE BEST!
