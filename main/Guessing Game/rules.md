# Guessing Game

This simple guessing game, will iteratively ask the User/Player to enter a number between 1 and 20 [Default settings] or will ask the User/Player to input their own range [choose option 'n']

* If the User's/Player's guess match, he/she will score 100 points, and the score is displayed. 
* If the User's/Player's guess doesn’t match, then the game starts all over again. 

### Exit Control

* If the User/Player enters -->  “t” or "T", then the game stops. 


### ALL THE BEST!
