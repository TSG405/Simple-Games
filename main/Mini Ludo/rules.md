# MINI-LUDO 

Inspired, from the traditional two-pvp  `LUDO` game -->> `Snakes & Ladders`, this game is a resemblance of the same!

Only, two players --> `A` & `B`,  will play this game in Multiplayer Mode (alternate -- fashion).

### MODUS - OPERANDI

* Both the players -- `A` & `B`, will be initialised from the starting cell --> CELL (1) , marked as `START`.
* Each player will get their alternative chances to roll the `Dice`.
* Based on the player's position, the player can move `Forward` or `Backward` (if valid!), as per choice.
* Ladders and Snakes, are marked as `GOTO` in the Game Board, with a pre-defined random value in the range of (1-49).
* The first player to reach the cell, marked as -- `END`, wins the game! 

And lastly, do follow the instructions ... while playing the game -- `MINI-LUDO`.


### ALL THE BEST!
