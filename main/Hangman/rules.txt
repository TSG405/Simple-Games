               WORD--HANGMAN
------------***-------------***---------------


The Word-Hangman is a simple game. The player/user will be provided with a WORD, having it's  ---  * First Letter * --- only!
Rest of it's letters will be left blank! For example:-->

t _ _ _ _ _ _  ,  for the WORD ---> "tangent".


The player/user has to guess the remaining letters in the given word. 
Type your "guessed letter" in small aphabetics, i.e [a -> z].

CONSTRAINT: The player can guess only one letter at a time. If the letter exists in the word, it will appear on the screen, with the updated WORD.

* If the letter doesnâ€™t exist in the word, it will be counted as a "Wrong Try"! [It includes -> if the player/user gives multi-lettered input, for eg: "ag" , "jhgb" , ... etc]

* If the player exceeds the number of wrong tries (given '10' in this game format), the player will lose the game.

* Otherwise, the player wins.




ALL THE BEST!
